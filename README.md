## **Phase 4: Specialization Paths**
Now branch into your specific interest:

### **For Computer Vision (OCR Focus):**
- Advanced CNNs
- Attention mechanisms

## **Timeline Estimate**
| Level | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Foundation | 6 months | Math+Algos solid |
| ML Core | 4 months | Can implement papers |
| DL Specialization | 6 months | Publication-ready projects |

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific project ideas for each phase?
2. Include a tooling roadmap (Docker, MLflow, etc)?
3. Focus more on the computer vision specialization path?

This provides a strong general foundation before specializing in your prescription OCR project. The math and algorithmic thinking will serve you well regardless of which ML subfield you pursue.
